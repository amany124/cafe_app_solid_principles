## ðŸ“š SOLID Implementation Highlights

* **S â€“ Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility.
* **O â€“ Open/Closed Principle:** Classes are open for extension but closed for modification.
* **L â€“ Liskov Substitution Principle:** Subtypes can replace base types without affecting functionality.
* **I â€“ Interface Segregation Principle:** Interfaces are small and focused, reducing unnecessary dependencies.
* **D â€“ Dependency Inversion Principle:** High-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
