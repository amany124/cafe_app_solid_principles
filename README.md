# â˜• Ahwa Ala Kefak â€“ SOLID Principles Demo App

## Project Description

**Ahwa Ala Kefak** is a simple Flutter mobile application designed to demonstrate the application of **SOLID principles** in object-oriented programming. The app allows users to **add customer orders with drink types (e.g., shai, Turkish coffee, hibiscus tea) and special instructions**, mark orders as completed, view pending orders, and generate basic reports of top-selling drinks and total orders served.

The focus of this app is on **clean, maintainable, and scalable code** rather than complex functionality.



## ðŸ§© Features

* **Order Management:** Add and complete customer orders.
* **Dashboard:** View pending orders.
* **Basic Reports:** Track top-selling drinks and total orders served.
* **SOLID Principles:** Code is structured following SOLID to demonstrate maintainability and modularity.



## ðŸ“š SOLID & OOP Implementation Highlights

* **S â€“ Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class handles one responsibility (e.g., `OrderManager` handles orders, `ReportGenerator` handles reports).
* **O â€“ Open/Closed Principle:** New drinks or features can be added without modifying existing code.
* **D â€“ Dependency Inversion Principle:** High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.
* **Encapsulation:** Order details are private and accessed through getters/setters.
* **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Different drink types inherit from a base `Drink` class.

**Justification:** Even in a simple app, applying these principles ensures the code is **modular, maintainable, and easy to extend**. This aligns with the **Object-Oriented Thought Process**, emphasizing abstraction, separation of concerns, and scalability.
